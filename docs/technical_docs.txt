Initial Processes:
1. Convert launch center geodetic coordinates to GCRS coordinates given the exact launch time.

Runtime:
1. GCRS cartesian coordinates are updated for each body every simulated hour.
2. Update forces to the shuttle per frame
3. Render all non-occluded celestial bodies
4. Render shuttle at GCRS coordinates
5. Analyze flight path, making adjustments to the shuttle rotation as necessary.
6. Subtract main engine fuel + RCS fuel
